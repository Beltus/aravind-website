A friend of mine once had a great wave of insight about the notions of "doubt" and "confidence". "It is all in the mind", he said very eager to gain our attention during a coffee break in the middle of a very busy day at work. We were all so frazzled with context-switching through meetings, presentations and fragmented solo work that we had no energy to resist. But in a twist that no one anticipated, he narrated a story of how an uncle of his had severely dented his confidence when he was still at school. As the story went, he had announced his intentions of appearing for a competitive entrance examination to qualify for a reputed engineering college. An uncle who had overheard his announcement to his parents, decided to wade into the matter. Given his modest academic achievements up until that point, his uncle rather derisively asked him, "Are you sure?" He said, "Of course!". But his pessimistic uncle persisted to ask him the same question a sufficient number of times, till his enthusiasm was cowed and his answer reduced to "It's not even such a great college!"
