  Hey Joe, glad you found my post helpful. You can check the [flexgallery
  code](https://github.com/iyeraravind/aravind-website/blob/master/_includes/flexgallery)
  and the frontmatter in the
  [Markdown](https://github.com/iyeraravind/aravind-website/blob/master/_posts/2017-12-15-reluctant-photographer.markdown)
  for the [photography
  post](https://www.aravindiyer.com/self/reluctant-photographer/). The `aspect`
  attribute needs to be supplied for each image, and the `end_row` attribute
  needs to be defined for the last image in a row, in case you want a multi-row
  gallery. Hope this help.
