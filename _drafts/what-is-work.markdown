We use the word “work” quite freely and frequently in our conversations. We use it without thinking and most of the time we understand what it means. I have myself used it without hesitation when wrote of how I took a [sabbatical from work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-03-how-i-came-to-take-sabbatical %}) and later when I wrote that [sabbatical is work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-11-lessons-from-sabbatical %}), and yet again to provide a positive ending to my [observations on loneliness]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-02-ambivalence-of-loneliness %}), I asked the reader to get to work. We want to do our best work and yet we seek work-life balance. We seek automation so that we may work smarter, and yet we are none the wiser how we should or might cope in a post-work world. In this background, it is probably worth asking and contemplating what work is exactly?

Rather than boldly propose a definition of work, it is useful to identify the different aspects of work. Work has many meanings or connotations, and listing them out can bring us closer to understanding what work is. Here are some characteristics we associate with work.

## Work is chores

Chores are routine tasks that need doing. They are necessary for us to maintain our home, our lifestyle, our legal status, our businesses, our software, or our health among other things. We may or may not like them, but chores preserve the status quo and prevent decay. It is generally easy to tell if a chore is done or not, and it is also a mostly straightforward process to perform one. If work were only chores, then the lack of work would be luxury.

## Work is livelihood

Livelihood is the means of securing the necessities and comforts of life. Work pays us the money to buy those needs and comforts. We donate our time, skills and effort towards work, and we get rewarded in proportion to the perceived scarcity of our capabilities. We may not be the best at it, and we may not like it all of the time, but we are always happy for the security of livelihood. If work were only livelihood, then the lack of work would be financial ill-health or dependence.

## Work is effort

Effort is the deliberate direction of energy towards achieving a goal. Work requires effort — physical, emotional, intellectual or all kinds. Sometimes, the effort may tire us, and at other times, it may spur us on. Our effort may be focussed and appropriate in intensity, or it may well be lacking or misdirected. Our efforts may bear fruit or they may be in vain. But it is unlikely that there is work without effort. If work were only effort, then the lack of work would be sloth.

## Work is value

Value is a measure of the merit or usefulness of something. Stones and metals are deemed valuable based on our collective perception of their lustre, beauty and longevity. Work is valuable in proportion to how well it maintains the status quo or how well it can be seen as improving upon it. Work is also valuable if it improves the manner in which other work is done by making it more efficient, less redundant or more fruitful. If work were only value, then the lack of work would be parasitic.

## Work is its own reward

A reward is often a compensation in recognition of an achievement. But it is also often the case that the mere process of your seeking and striving towards an achievement results in a build-up of moral value which no one can confer upon you. Regardless of whether work maintains the status quo or wins the bread or consumes your energy or creates external value, work can sometimes be just worth it. If only that which was rewarding by itself was work, then the lack of work would be the erosion of our self-worth.

If we accept these characteristics of work, then we can examine whether social stereotype roles are work or not. Being a bread-winner is evidently work since it provides livelihood, at the very least. Being a home-maker is also work since it maintains the value of “home” (upkeep and improvement of its infrastructure and inhabitants).

Where does the disquiet from work or lack of work come from? I think it comes from the above needs not being met. It relates to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and whether those needs are met or not.

What is work-life balance? I think it might be more apt to look at it as balanced work — one that satisfies all the needs and characteristics of work. Perhaps, if a single job doesn’t satisfy all — then maybe a combination of activities could constitute work.

The perspective that work is in a race against life needs to change.
