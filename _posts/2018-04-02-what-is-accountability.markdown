"No Man is an Island" observed John Donne solemnly alluding to the connected fabric of humanity. Martin Luther King Jr. also referred to it when he avered "I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be" and vice versa.

Accountability is submitting yourself to be evaluated by another. It is the act of reposing your trust in the fabric of humanity and allowing yourself to be judged.

Whatever be your endeavour - regular employment, own business, artistic pursuit, competitive sports - ultimately your value needs to be recognised by another
