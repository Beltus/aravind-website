Writing a hundred words may come easier to some than to others. For me, it usually depends on my state of inspiration, for want of a better term. Right now, I am really not sure where this conversation may turn. But I bravely soldier on.

When I was still at school and considered "good at English", a well-meaning teacher suggested to me that I should practice writing essays to improve my language skills and specifically my writing skills. The drill was to pick a topic - usually a mundane and everyday topic - and then proceed to write a short essay about it. Typical school essays were constructed according to a fairly standard template - you know, explain what you understand by the topic, write some facts about it that you know, maybe connect it to some current happenings and as a bonus, maybe even narrate a personal story or anecdote which relates to the topic.

I thought it was a pretty good idea. And since I wasn't as given to contemplation as I seem to be these days, I would just plunge into one and keep writing. After a judicious number of paragraphs, I would pause and think about how to conclude the piece, and then just do so. Easy-peasy! Funnily while writing many of those essays, I used to think that one day I will grow up and start doing some serious writing. It is quite the coming full circle that now after much growing up or at least passage of time, I am back to the old grind!
