To describe [Autumn Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Leaves_(1945_song)) as a [jazz standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_standard), would probably be an understatement. Sure, it is a *standard* part of the musical repertoire of jazz musicians, and is widely known by jazz listeners. But this 1945 composition by [Joseph Kosma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kosma) with lyrics written in [French](https://genius.com/Jacques-prevert-les-feuilles-mortes-annotated) by [Jacques Prévert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Pr%C3%A9vert) and later in [English](https://genius.com/Johnny-mercer-autumn-leaves-lyrics) by [Johnny Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mercer), has found a much wider appeal and coverage, including covers by popular artists like [Eric Clapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton), [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) and [Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(musician)). At its core, Autumn Leaves is a song of nostalgia, of fond and yearning memories of a time of romance. But with legions of artists covering it year after year, for over seven decades, the expressive power of the song occupies a much wider canvas. To give you an idea, here are ten different takes on Autumn Leaves.

## Frank Sinatra
The charismatic [Frank Sinatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra) sings one of the most canonical, true to the core, renditions of Autumn Leaves. Full of feeling and yet not overly sentimental, musically on point but without excessive ornamentation, Sinatra's version from his album [Where are you?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Are_You%3F_(Frank_Sinatra_album)) recorded in 1957, lays down the reference.

## Cannonball Adderley with Miles Davis
The great jazz icon, trumpeter [Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis) used to perform Autumn Leaves regularly during his live performances in the early 60s. Here is a studio version recorded in 1958, with Davis on [sideman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician) duty in saxophone great [Cannonball Adderley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Adderley)'s band in the album [Somethin' else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somethin%27_Else_(Cannonball_Adderley_album)). Beginning with a catchy [vamp](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/jazzglossary/v/vamp.html), the band rhythmically builds up a feeling of anticipation about the song, till after a second's pause, Davis steps in to quote the familiar tune! Adderley takes the first solo, followed by Davis and [Hank Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Jones) on piano, all the while ably supported by the rhythm secion of [Sam Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jones_(musician)) on bass and [Art Blakey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Blakey) on drums.

## Bill Evans Trio
While on sideman duty with Adderley, Davis was recruiting him to record [Kind of Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue), one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. A key musician who featured in that album was the genius pianist [Bill Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans). Soon after recording Kind of Blue, Evans recruited bassist [Scott LaFaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_LaFaro) and drummer [Paul Motian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Motian) to form his trio. Here is Autumn Leaves from their album [Portrait in Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_in_Jazz) recorded in 1959. After Evans quotes the tune, it seems that LaFaro is taking the first solo. But it is actually Evans, LaFaro and Motian trading musical statements with one another, with no explicit "rhythm section". Then the band snaps into groove with Evans' solo before reprising the tune at the end.

## Barbra Streisand
It was only my ignorance, but I first heard about [Barbra Streisand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand) as champion tennis player [Andre Agassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi)'s older girlfriend. Later I learned that she was a multi-talented genius, a singer, actor and filmmaker, equally acclaimed in each field of artistic endeavour! Here she is, soulfully, singing Autumn Leaves in French and English, in a recording from her 1966 album [Je m'appelle Barbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je_m%27appelle_Barbra).

## Jim Hall and Ron Carter
An unassuming man in person, the almost not famous [Jim Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hall_(musician)) is considered so influential to jazz guitar that [Jason Shadrick wrote](http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/20043-remembering-jim-hall-1930-2013) for [Premier Guitar](https://www.premierguitar.com/) that "It could be argued that the jazz guitar tree is rooted in four names: [Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt), [Charlie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Christian), [Wes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Montgomery), and *Jim*." [Ron Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Carter), a Miles Davis [alumnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis_Quintet#Second_great_quintet_(1964-68)), is a legendary and prolific jazz bassist - a veritable [Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)) having carried the rhythmic weight of over [two thousand](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/1/ron-carter-earns-world-record-as-the-most-recorded-jazz-bassist-in-history-411828) jazz recordings. Here they perform Autumn Leaves as a [duet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet) in their 1972 album [Alone Together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_Together_(Ron_Carter_and_Jim_Hall_album)).

## Chet Baker
[Chet Baker](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography), an accomplished jazz trumpeter, nearly destroyed his musical career in the late 60s and early 70s, owing to his drug addiction. He mounted a comeback after five years of musical inactivity through his 1974 album [She Was Too Good to Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Was_Too_Good_to_Me). With illustrious guest musicians, [Paul Desmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Desmond) on alto saxophone and [Milt Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milt_Jackson) on vibes, and band members [Hubert Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Laws) on flute, [Bob James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_James_(musician)) on keyboards and the profilic rhythm section of Ron Carter on bass and [Steve Gadd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gadd) on drums, Baker shows that there was much music still left in him!

## Sarah Vaughan
[Sarah Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan), an iconic jazz singer, popularly known as "Sassy", was so wonderfully gifted that it once made [Sinatra comment](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=NVcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) "Sassy is so good" that it made him want to "cut my wrists!" Here she is scatting her way with genius and abandon through Autumn Leaves in her Grammy nominated 1982 album [Crazy and Mixed Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_and_Mixed_Up). Also check out the great guitar solo by [Joe Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pass) and the tight backing of Vaughan's rhythm section of [Roland Hanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Hanna) on piano, [Andy Simpkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Simpkins) on bass and [Harold Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Jones_(drummer)) on drums.
