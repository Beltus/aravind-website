excerpt: "A friend sent me the Jazztronica playlist from Spotify. Jaga Jazzist opened with Lithuania and I was hooked. It’s a Chemical Brothers meet Weather Report kind of vibe, and it really works! I can even quote my immediate reactions as I heard it for the first few times — 'Smooth, engaging, loopy, hypnotic even!' I had texted back enthusiastically. Lithuania starts with a catchy loop of electronic tones and real instruments, and soon proceeds to add layer upon layer of new loops, but somehow managing to make the end result sound like a bona fide arrangement of jazz music."

Does [art imitate life](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-psychology-fiction/201104/does-art-imitate-life),
or does [life imitate art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imitating_art)? It is a question that has been
debated intensely. Perhaps, art needs the constituents of life to be authentic, but life too needs the
idealisation of art to aspire to. It is not much different with music. Music is made from sound, but it is also
repurposed back as sound, serving all manner of non musical purposes, like tones for public announcements, chimes
and beeps for alarms and notifications, and even [musical rumble strips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_road)[^musicrumblestrips]
which keep vehicle drivers alert. Of course, not all sound is music. A single note may be just sound, but the
qualities of that sound are very important, shaping the music that emerges out of those sounds. Like most
musicians, I am sure [Jaga Jazzist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaga_Jazzist) cares deeply about the sound of
their music. And while “multi-layered” may be a term more apt for describing a
[story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story) or a movie, the
[music](https://ninjatune.net/artist/jaga-jazzist) of Jaga Jazzist evokes precisely that kind of impression
— of hearing the multi-layered sound of music.

[^musicrumblestrips]: The idea of a musical road is sheer genius! Using an ordinary rumble strip to rouse the inattentive or sleepy driver, is one thing. But it is a much more sophisticated and artistic nudge to the driver, to carefully engineer grooves in the road so as to produce a recognisable musical tune through the vibration and sounds induced in a crossing car!

The first song of Jaga Jazzist (pronounced “Yaa-gaa Yaa-zist”) that I heard was “Lithuania” from their
album “[A Livingroom Hush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Livingroom_Hush)”. It was the first song in
a playlist shared with me by a fellow music-loving [friend](https://medium.com/@prateeks). I had asked him
if he had any listening suggestions for electronic music, when we had worked together, for a drums and
percussion workshop. As you probably know or guessed, electronic music is made using electronic rather
than acoustic instruments. But more importantly, it aims to sound distinct from regular musicians playing
music, by incorporating repetitive loops, sound effects and programming. So we chatted a bit about
electronic music, on which he has expressed some
[very interesting views](https://medium.com/@prateeks/soundscapes-and-why-edm-is-the-music-for-today-738a669ac83b)[^prateekedm].
Some time later, he sent me what was the snapshot of the Jazztronica playlist on Spotify at the time.
Jaga Jazzist opened with Lithuania and I was hooked. Thanks to the permanence of digital media, I can
even quote my immediate reactions as I heard it for the first few times — “Smooth, engaging, loopy,
hypnotic even!” I had texted back enthusiastically.

[^prateekedm]: [Prateek Sharma](https://medium.com/@prateeks) writes at [Medium](https://medium.com) why EDM is the [music for today](https://medium.com/@prateeks/soundscapes-and-why-edm-is-the-music-for-today-738a669ac83b). Sharma argues that digital or electronic sounds and tones have become such a ubiquitous part of our lives that music built using those kinds of sounds is bound to feel natural and contemporary.

Being an album kind of guy[^albumguy], I promptly had
[A Livingroom Hush](https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-livingroom-hush-mw0000660007) on rotation.
Lithuania starts with a catchy loop of electronic tones and real instruments, and soon proceeds to
add layer upon layer of new loops, but somehow managing to make the end result sound like a *bona fide*
arrangement of jazz music. It’s a [Chemical Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers)
meet [Weather Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Report) kind of vibe, and it really works!
I have never gotten much into mainstream electronica, preferring jazz or rock music more. But I have a
soft spot for music that blurs genre boundaries and creates a new kind of sound. I remember
[Jeff Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck)’s album
“[Who Else!](https://www.allmusic.com/album/who-else%21-mw0000602855)” where Beck uses the electronica
sound as a contemporary backdrop against which he plays his usual, soulful rock guitar. But Jaga Jazzist
go much further with A Livingroom Hush. Here is a nine piece band which mixes live music play with
synthesised loops in jazzy scales, but is always resolutely committed to a big picture sound where
the part should not overwhelm the whole.

[^albumguy]: It maybe almost a *retro* thing, but I am an album kind of guy. I believe in the concept of an album as a valid unit of musical work. Not to be overly philosophical, but music reflects the state of being of the artists. So songs produced in the same confines of space and time share the artists' state of being, as of that time, making the *album* a cohesive unit of musical work. 

Jaga Jazzist hail from [Norway](http://www.listento.no/), and they first achieved
[critical acclaim](http://www.listento.no/mic.nsf/doc/art2003010611203678263218) when BBC listeners
voted “A Livingroom Hush” as the [jazz album of the year 2002](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zn4h/).
But their story started much earlier when the band was formed in 1994 with brothers
[Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Horntveth) and
[Lars Horntveth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Horntveth) and
[Ivar Christian Johansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_%28Ivar_Johansen%29). In an
[interview from 2006](https://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/jaga-jazzist), Martin Horntveth talks about
the early days of the band, “The idea was to just have a very big band, which is quite normal in the
jazz tradition, but, playing not that jazzy music, [but] more music influenced by rock, hip-hop,
drum n’ bass, all kinds of music, [specifically] electronic music.” So they got together a bunch of
musicians from different backgrounds including rock, jazz and European classical music, and “just
started rehearsing every Tuesday”. Their first album
[Jaevla Jazzist Grete Stitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jævla_Jazzist_Grete_Stitz) was supposedly
a mixture of “[playful jazz and touches of rap](http://www.mic.no/nmi.nsf/micdoc/art2006051610322966135500)”,
while it was their second outing titled “[Magazine](https://www.allmusic.com/album/magazine-ep-mw0001294012)”
which saw younger brother Lars Horntveth emerge as the de-facto composer for Jaga Jazzist. 

Lars Horntveth in several interviews for Jaga Jazzist has cited a wide array of musicians as his
inspiration. Depending on the music you listen to, you might hear your favourite artists among those
cited by Horntveth, in Jaga Jazzist. For example, I can hear the fusion sound from
[Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis)’ albums
“[In a Silent Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Silent_Way)” and
“[Bitches Brew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitches_Brew)”, where he experimented with larger bands,
even including two drummers, with his focus being more on the overall collective sound.
There is a bit of [Charles Mingus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus)’
[Big Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_Big_Band) sound, and maybe even
[Concierto de Aranjuez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierto_de_Aranjuez), which Horntveth has
said he would like to be
[played at his funeral](https://www.allaboutjazz.com/with-lars-horntveth-jaga-jazzist-jaga-jazzist-by-lars-horntveth.php?page=1).
[Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich) is also an influence — I heard him
first in the process of writing this review — for his clean
[minimalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music) arrangement of sounds again emphasising
the collective rather than the individual. But Horntveth also says lightheartedly that his influences keep
[changing all the time](https://www.allaboutjazz.com/with-lars-horntveth-jaga-jazzist-jaga-jazzist-by-lars-horntveth.php?page=1)!
Influences aside, I think Jaga Jazzist have managed to create their own signature sound which you can
hear in albums recorded as far apart as A Livingroom Hush (released in 2001) and
[Starfire](https://jagajazzist.bandcamp.com/album/starfire) (released in 2015). 

For me, the two big highlights on the Livingroom Hush album are
[Airborne](https://youtu.be/C0nHo1IdQ6E) and Lithuania. Airborne starts off with a flowing passage
punctuated by the drums and a percussion track which sounds like radio static, with the melody played
by a baritone saxophone, before launching into a jaunty, stuttering tune in 7/8 rhythm. It slowly but
progressively keeps gaining in intensity with a short pop-friendly solo to round it off, before receding
back into the passage from the beginning. It is a great example of Jaga Jazzist’s ability to meld
electronic samples and a jazzy scale into an almost danceable number (read this if you dig a 
[technical dissection](https://sites.google.com/site/thepopdescriptivist/home/jaga-jazzist-airborne)).
[Lithuania](https://youtu.be/2MferjKXc1c) follows a similar pattern of adding layer upon layer of music
till the song bursts out in crescendo. There is a certain feeling of quiet in the song (the hush of
the living room, perhaps) which is modulated so smoothly in intensity that the listener may well wonder
at the crescendo — now just when did this song get this loud? To me, this is a worthy electronica
successor to Miles Davis’ [Shh/Peaceful](https://youtu.be/lQKt7DTKyJU).

Despite having heard the band for only about a year, I have really enjoyed Jaga Jazzist’s music. So
does art imitate life? Someone pointed out to me how the phone icon on a smartphone imitates an old
life — a landline telephone receiver — while the icon of Uber is not just a stylised “U” but imitates
a new life, symbolising their network and the
“[manipulation of bits and atoms](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/the-inside-story-behind-ubers-colorful-redesign/)”[^ubericon].
Like digital imagery, digital sounds too are no longer abstractions of analog sounds, but synthetic
tones we accept as *bona fide* originals. Now, of course, icons and tones are less art and more
utilitarian. But with Jaga Jazzist, behind the sheen of electronica, past the multi-layered sound of
their music, there is art imitating the sounds of today’s life and creating a fascinating world of music.
Go, give it a [listen](#electronic-jazz-from-jaga-jazzist)!

[^ubericon]: [Jessi Hempel](https://www.wired.com/author/jessi-hempel/) at [Wired](https://www.wired.com/) writes about the ["inside story"](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/the-inside-story-behind-ubers-colorful-redesign/) behind Uber's new iconography as of 2016. The so-called mood boards for the Uber icon in different countries represent a fascinating fusion of a general design language with a signature shape associated with each specific country. Tiling that shape creates a pattern which in a subtle way cues the identity of that country.
